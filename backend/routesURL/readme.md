All of the previous routes were only accessible from interacting directly
within tree.tabors.site or be.tabors.site

So I am making new routes that are URL based and allow everything to be accessed/done
through URL, allowing other systems to interact through a common API.

Will need to enforce token authentication at end and also allow people to find their
token on front end menu
